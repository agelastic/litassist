Prompt Engineering Nuances for OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini

Prompt engineering best practices share common themes across modern LLMs, but each model family also has unique nuances. Below we detail techniques and parameters especially effective for OpenAI’s GPT series (including the latest GPT-5 and O-series models), Anthropic’s Claude family (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4, Opus 3/4.1), and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro. We cover a range of use cases – with priority on reasoning and creative writing – and highlight model-specific tips for coding, formatting, and more.

OpenAI GPT-Series (GPT-4, GPT-5, and O-Series Models)

OpenAI’s GPT models are highly capable generalists with strong instruction-following and tool-use abilities. The latest GPT-5 introduced in 2025 is a unified system that can decide when to “think longer” or use tools, and the “O-series” (e.g. OpenAI o3, o4-mini) are specialized variants trained for extended reasoning ￼ ￼. Key prompt engineering techniques and parameters include:
	•	Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning: In earlier GPT-3/4 models, adding “Let’s think step by step” to a complex question often dramatically improved logical accuracy by prompting multi-step reasoning ￼. This zero-shot chain-of-thought hack remains useful. GPT-5 has gone a step further – it will automatically engage deeper reasoning when needed, and you can explicitly trigger its “thinking” mode by phrases like “think hard about this” in your prompt ￼. For example, telling GPT-5 “Please analyze thoroughly – think hard about this problem” signals it to allocate more internal reasoning, similar to switching on its expert mode.
	•	System Role Instructions: OpenAI’s chat models allow a system message or upfront role definition to steer style and perspective. Leverage this by defining a persona or role at the start of the prompt. For instance: “You are an expert baker who explains recipes with fun metaphors.” This persistent context helps GPT stick to a desired voice or domain ￼ ￼. In the ChatGPT UI, you can use Custom Instructions or the system field to set this context. This technique is especially powerful for creative writing (e.g. “Respond in the style of Shakespeare” yields remarkably styled prose ￼) and for focusing expertise (e.g. “As a financial analyst, answer the following…”).
	•	Few-Shot Examples: GPT models respond well to examples. For complex tasks or formatting, provide one or two Q&A examples or demonstrations in the prompt. This helps the model infer the pattern of the desired output ￼ ￼. For instance, if you need a specific JSON format, you might show a dummy example of input and the correctly formatted JSON output, then ask it to do the same for your actual query. OpenAI models have strong generalization, so often even one example suffices.
	•	Output Formatting Directions: Be explicit about the format and length you need. OpenAI GPT will usually follow instructions like “Give the answer in a numbered list” or “Limit the response to two sentences.” Including target formats in quotes or brackets can help (e.g. “Output the result as a JSON object with keys X and Y.”). GPT is quite adept at producing structured outputs (code, JSON, markdown tables, etc.) when instructed ￼ ￼. For code in particular, wrapping your request in triple backticks and specifying the language (e.g. “python` ... ”) yields well-formatted code in the response. GPT-4/5 also supports function calling, where you provide a function signature and the model will output a JSON object of arguments – use this when you must enforce structure.
	•	Tool Use and Extended Reasoning: The newer OpenAI O-series models (like o3) are trained to use tools agentically within ChatGPT ￼. They can decide to search the web, use a code interpreter, or analyze images as part of answering. As a user, you don’t need to micromanage tool use – just enable the feature (e.g. browsing, code execution) and ask your question normally. The model will autonomously invoke tools when appropriate ￼. If using the API, you can simulate this via the function calling interface or by providing a structured prompt that includes tool descriptions. The key prompt nuance is to hint when external info or calculation is needed; e.g. “(If needed, you can use the search tool.)”. GPT-5’s default behavior is to apply reasoning or tool use automatically for harder problems, but it still respects direct instructions – so you can say “show your reasoning steps” if you want the rationale in the answer.
	•	Creative Writing and Style Control: GPT excels at creative tasks when given clear stylistic guidance. You can specify tone, genre, or perspective: e.g. “Write a dystopian opening paragraph in a concise, suspenseful tone”. OpenAI models tend to produce engaging content by default, but to get a specific style, it helps to name it (or even provide a “style snippet” example). They handle instructions like “use vivid sensory details” or “include dialogue between the characters” well, often requiring less back-and-forth than other models. In comparisons, GPT-5 was noted for “faster worldbuilding and tighter prose” in creative writing prompts ￼ – it needs minimal prodding to produce rich, coherent narratives. Still, if the output is too verbose or not focusing on the right elements, don’t hesitate to add constraints (e.g. “focus on the protagonist’s feelings in one paragraph, then end with a cliffhanger”).
	•	Parameters – Temperature, Top_p, etc.: OpenAI’s API exposes temperature and top_p to control randomness. For factual or analytical tasks, use a low temperature (~0 to 0.3) to keep the model deterministic and on-topic. For brainstorming and creative tasks, a higher temperature (0.7–0.9) can yield more diverse, imaginative outputs ￼. It’s usually best to adjust either temperature or top_p, not both, to avoid unpredictable behavior ￼. The OpenAI defaults (temperature ~1, top_p 1) produce a good balance of creativity and coherence. Additionally, GPT models have max context lengths to consider – GPT-4 allowed up to 8K or 32K tokens, and GPT-5 improved memory further. If you have a long prompt (e.g. providing a full article to summarize), ensure it stays within the model’s context limit. You may compress or omit less relevant parts, as going near the limit can reduce output quality.
	•	GPT-5 Pro Mode: For the most demanding tasks, GPT-5 offers a “Pro” variant available to certain users, which is essentially GPT-5 with extended reasoning time and resources ￼ ￼. In practice, the main difference is that GPT-5 Pro will think more steps through complex problems and produce more comprehensive answers. If you have access to GPT‑5 Pro, you can simply select it – no special prompt needed to benefit from its depth. But even GPT-5’s standard mode can be forced into deeper analysis by user cues. A helpful prompt nuance (as mentioned) is explicitly asking it to take its time or think thoroughly, which for GPT-5 triggers its internal router to engage the deeper “GPT-5 thinking” model ￼. For example: “This is tricky; really take your time to reason this out step by step before answering.” GPT-5 will then automatically apply more internal computation to your query.

In summary, OpenAI’s GPT series is quite flexible – they follow clear instructions closely and even anticipate needs (like using tools or switching reasoning mode) if you phrase your prompt naturally. Use the system role for global behavior, encourage chain-of-thought for complex reasoning, and fine-tune creativity with temperature and style directives. GPT models are generally forgiving, so a conversational tone in prompts works well, but more precision yields more exact outputs ￼ ￼.

Anthropic Claude Series (Claude 3.7, Claude 4: Sonnet, Opus, etc.)

Anthropic’s Claude models are trained with a “Constitutional AI” approach that emphasizes helpful, honest, and harmless responses. They are known for their long context (100k+ tokens) and strong reasoning when given the opportunity to “think.” The Claude 4 family introduced tiers like Claude Sonnet 4 (high-performance, efficient) and Claude Opus 4 (flagship, maximal reasoning and coding power) ￼. When prompting Claude models, consider the following nuances:
	•	Extended Chain-of-Thought Mode: Claude can be explicitly encouraged to produce a step-by-step reasoning scratchpad before its final answer. In Anthropic’s API, this is called “extended thinking” mode. When enabled, Claude will output a delineated reasoning process (which can span hundreds or thousands of tokens) and then the answer ￼. This yields significant gains on complex problems. To use it, you might include an instruction like: “Show your reasoning step-by-step in a <thinking> block, then give the final answer.” In fact, Anthropic suggests that without an outputted chain-of-thought, the model won’t fully engage in stepwise reasoning internally ￼. So if you want Claude’s best reasoning, ask it to “think out loud.” For example, prompt: “Solve this math problem. Think step-by-step, showing your work, and then conclude with the answer.” This is a general CoT (chain-of-thought) prompt that Claude responds well to ￼.
	•	High-Level vs. Step-by-Step Instructions: Interestingly, Anthropic’s guidance notes that Claude often performs better when given a broad prompt to “think deeply” about a problem rather than an overly prescriptive list of steps ￼. You can start with general reasoning instructions (e.g. “Please consider this problem thoroughly and explore different approaches, documenting your reasoning.”) – this leverages Claude’s own strategy to tackle the task. Only if it struggles should you fall back to more granular step-by-step directives. This nuance is because Claude’s creative problem-solving may exceed a human’s prescribed steps ￼. In summary: first encourage deep thinking in general terms, then refine with specific step guidance if needed.
	•	Using <thinking> Tags or Scratchpad: When providing examples or few-shot prompts to Claude, you can annotate the reasoning in a special way. Anthropic recommends using XML-style tags like <thinking> ... </thinking> or <scratchpad> around reasoning text ￼ ￼. This helps the model recognize what format you want its internal thoughts in. For instance, a few-shot example might show how to solve a problem:

Q: [some problem]  
<thinking> step 1: ...; step 2: ...; ... </thinking>  
A: [final answer]  

When Claude sees this, it will imitate the pattern in its response, separating thought and answer accordingly ￼ ￼. Even without the special tags, you can ask Claude to structure its answer as “Reasoning: … Answer: …”. But the tags help focus its attention and later you can easily parse out the reasoning. (In Anthropic’s extended thinking mode, the API actually returns the reasoning and final answer separately, but the tags approach is useful in the normal mode or for few-shot training.)

	•	Role and Tone Instructions: Claude, by default, behaves as a friendly, knowledgeable assistant. It’s less inclined to break character or produce unsafe content due to its constitutional training. You can still use system or context prompts to modify its style or role. For example: “You are ClaudeBot, a witty storytelling AI.” In Claude’s own web interface, a hidden system prompt supplies context (date, etc.) and guidelines ￼ ￼, but via API you must include such instructions in the user prompt or a system field if provided. Claude will usually follow style requests (e.g. “respond in a casual tone” or “use bullet points”). Just note that it prioritizes ethical and harmless behavior heavily – no prompt engineering should attempt to override its core safety principles (it will refuse). On the positive side, this means you can trust it to handle sensitive queries with nuance. If you need a very specific persona or format, be clear and persistent; Claude might occasionally insert polite prefaces or remain verbose out of helpfulness. Gently instruct it if you want a terse answer or a strict format (e.g. “Answer very concisely without added commentary.”).
	•	Large Context Strategies: One of Claude’s standout features is handling extremely large context (up to 200K tokens) ￼ ￼. This is invaluable for tasks like analyzing long documents, codebases, or multi-turn conversations. To use it effectively: you can literally paste book chapters or large knowledge bases into the prompt. Claude can “digest entire books or codebases” in one go ￼. However, structure the prompt for focus – use section headings or <document>…</document> tags around large text to help Claude navigate. Anthropic’s research found that when prompting with huge documents, it’s best to put the specific question or instruction after the long content (at the end of the prompt) ￼. This way, the model reads the documents first, then sees the question last and is more likely to remember to answer it. You can also explicitly tell Claude to refer back to the context: e.g. “Using the above text, answer the following…”. When dealing with multi-source or multi-part inputs, label them clearly (e.g. “Document A: … Document B: …”) and ask for synthesis.
	•	Creative Writing and Content Generation: Claude is a strong creative writer as well. It has a slightly different style from GPT – often verbose, very coherent, and eager to comply with the requested form. Claude Sonnet 4 is described as “balanced…ideal for content generation” ￼, meaning it’s cost-effective and tuned for tasks like writing narratives, dialog, or articles. Prompt techniques for creative tasks include giving Claude an imagined scenario or role (“Act as a medieval storyteller narrating an adventure…”), or even chaining prompts (first ask for an outline, then ask it to expand each section – Claude will excel at consistency over long outputs). Because of Claude’s long memory, it can generate lengthy stories or multi-chapter drafts in one session. If you want it to stick to a particular plot or style, you might provide an outline and say “follow this outline.” Claude will diligently fill in details while respecting the structure. One nuance: Claude tends to follow instructions very literally, so ensure your creative prompt isn’t too restrictive unless you mean it. For example, if you say “never use the word ‘said’ in the dialogue,” it will comply and use alternatives, but that might make the text stilted – so only give such stylistic rules if you really want them.
	•	Coding and “Agentic” Tasks: Anthropic touts Claude Opus 4 as “the world’s best coding model” with agentic capabilities ￼ ￼. For coding prompts, Claude is extremely useful especially when you provide context like file contents or error messages. It can write functions, debug, and even simulate multi-file edits when paired with tool use. In prompt engineering for coding:
	•	Ask for code in markdown – Claude’s default system prompt already suggests it should provide markdown for any code ￼. So typically it will produce a nice formatted code block.
	•	If you want explanation or not: By default Claude often explains its code. If you only want the code, say “Provide only the code and no explanation.” Conversely, you can request “Comment each step within the code” or “Explain the code after providing it.” It will oblige.
	•	Claude can handle multi-step coding workflows. For example, you can have a conversation where you iteratively refine code. Its longer memory shines here – you might paste a large piece of code and ask Claude to refactor or find bugs, and it can keep track of the entire codebase (tens of thousands of lines potentially). Use this by incrementally feeding code and instructions, rather than trying to fit it all in one prompt, to mimic a pair-programming session.
	•	Agentic actions: Claude can function like an “AI agent” that plans and executes tasks (within the limits of the API). Anthropic has tool APIs (e.g. a web search or bash execution) which Claude can utilize ￼. If you’re using such features, structure the prompt to present the task and the available tools, and Claude will reason about when to use which tool. A simple prompt might be: “You can use the following tools: [Tool descriptions]. Here is a user request: ‘…’. You should think step-by-step, use tools as needed, and then give the final answer.” Claude has been optimized for this kind of loop, especially Opus 4 which can “take actions over time” autonomously ￼.
	•	Parameters and Formatting Controls: The Anthropic API uses similar parameters to OpenAI: temperature, top_p, top_k, etc. One important note: Claude models do not support setting both temperature and top_p simultaneously (for Opus 4.1, you must choose one) ￼. Typically you can stick with temperature. The interpretation is the same: low temp for stability, high for creativity. Claude also has a notion of “stop sequences” you can specify – e.g. you could use a stop sequence like "\nHuman:" to prevent it from going past an answer in a chat loop. In practice, you rarely need custom stop sequences unless doing something programmatic. Another parameter is max_tokens: Claude can output very long answers (its max output is 32k-64k tokens depending on model ￼). If you expect a long result (like a chapter of a book), be sure to set max_tokens sufficiently high. Claude is generally good at not exceeding what’s necessary, but if you only get partial output, you may need to increase the limit or prompt it to continue.

In summary, Claude thrives when you “let it think”. Give it room to work through problems with either an explicit reasoning section or at least a prompt that says “take a moment to reason this out.” It is very strong at handling nuanced, lengthy interactions: you can have it discuss a philosophical dilemma in depth or analyze a lengthy policy document. Use its large context to your advantage by feeding in all relevant info. Just remember that Claude is very literal and aligned – it won’t violate the ethical guardrails, and it will try to do exactly what you ask. So craft prompts that are clear and thorough, and Claude will respond with thorough clarity as well.

Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (and Related Gemini Models)

Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro is a state-of-the-art multimodal model, meaning it can accept not just text but images, audio, and even video as part of the prompt ￼. It also features an enormous 1 million token context window ￼ – far exceeding what GPT-4 or Claude handle – and uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically routes parts of the prompt to different expert networks ￼. Prompt engineering for Gemini revolves around harnessing these capabilities while compensating for some differences in style compared to OpenAI/Anthropic models:
	•	Multimodal Prompts: One of the biggest nuances is you can literally embed different media in a Gemini prompt. For example, you might provide an image (or a link to it, depending on interface) and ask, “Based on the above image, describe X.” Or give an audio clip transcript along with a question about it. The key is to reference the modality clearly: “Image: [description or identifier]. Question: …” In prompting Gemini, treat non-text input as part of the prompt structure. A simple case: “Here is an image of a graph (attached). Analyze the trends shown in the graph.” Gemini will “see” the image and incorporate it into its reasoning. This unlocks creative use cases (e.g. “Write a story about this picture” or “Describe the emotion in this voice recording”). Just ensure any file inputs are in supported formats and within the huge context limit. The ability to mix text + image + audio in one prompt means you can have very dynamic interactions – use this to your advantage by supplying rich input. For instance, for a coding task you could provide a diagram of a UI and the code file text, and ask Gemini to update the code to match the UI changes. Always label each part (image, code, etc.) so the model knows what it’s looking at.
	•	Huge Context, Complex Instructions: With a 1M token window, Gemini can take in essentially entire repositories, books, or datasets as input ￼. This means you can conceive prompting strategies that weren’t feasible before. For instance, you could prepend a large knowledge base or multiple examples at the start of the prompt without running out of space. Few-shot learning with dozens of examples is possible (though note, quality of examples still matters more than quantity). When giving Gemini a very large prompt, help it out by structuring and signposting. Use headings, bullet points, or section separators in your prompt to delineate different content. Given the MoE architecture, Gemini is likely to route different sections to different experts (e.g. code parts to a coding expert, math parts to a math expert) ￼. To trigger the right expertise, format parts of the prompt in a way that invokes that domain. For example, include code syntax if you want coding help, or math formulas (LaTeX or plain text) if you want it to engage its math skills. The model was trained on varied modalities and programming languages ￼ ￼, so it recognizes these patterns.
	•	Guiding Reasoning and Answers: In evaluations, Gemini 2.5 Pro is extremely knowledgeable and capable, but reviewers have noted its responses can be overly verbose or less focused without guidance. For instance, in a creative writing prompt test, Gemini’s output was “overly descriptive” and lacked a strong hook compared to GPT-5’s tighter prose ￼. To get the best creative output from Gemini, consider instructing it on style and focus: “Keep the narrative tight and impactful; avoid unnecessary description.” Because Gemini tends to be generous with detail, adding “be concise” or “focus on key plot points” in a creative prompt can yield a more engaging result. For persuasive or analytical writing, if you find Gemini gives a somewhat generic or “thematic” answer, prompt it to be concrete: e.g. “List specific examples rather than speaking in generalities.”
	•	Formatting Consistency: Users have observed that Gemini sometimes struggles to stick strictly to a required format, especially when compared to OpenAI’s models. For example, if asked for an answer only in JSON, Gemini might still include a preamble or commentary unless explicitly told not to. To ensure compliance, be very explicit: “Output only a JSON object with the following fields… No explanation or extra text.” If it still wavers, you can even add a final user prompt like “Remember: only output JSON.” (In a multi-turn setting.) Similarly, for code outputs, mention “provide only the code within one fenced block.” This reduces the chance of format deviations. Over time, Gemini has improved – in fact, newer versions are “more willing to engage with prompts that previous models may have incorrectly refused” ￼ and are better at following instructions. But when precision matters, double down on clarity in your prompt. After generation, you should still validate format (especially if feeding into a parser).
	•	Step-by-Step Reasoning: Although Google hasn’t publicized a “think step by step” cue like OpenAI, the chain-of-thought prompting approach works similarly on Gemini due to its training on a wide corpus (likely including reasoning patterns). If you have a complex problem (math word problem, logical puzzle, multi-step reasoning scenario), it can help to prompt: “Work out the solution step by step, then give the final answer.” This encourages Gemini to break down the problem. Keep in mind, with the mixture-of-experts design, the model is already internally doing some routing of subtasks – but an explicit CoT prompt will still guide the output structure and make the reasoning transparent. One benefit of Gemini’s huge context is you could include intermediate data or sub-questions in the prompt for it to consider. For example: “(You might find it useful to first enumerate what we know, then deduce each part. Do so in your answer.)” By doing this, you leverage its high-level reasoning strength while ensuring it doesn’t skip steps. In head-to-head tests, GPT-5 often outperformed Gemini on tricky reasoning challenges ￼ ￼ – likely because GPT-5 had refined internal methods. To close that gap, a prompt engineer using Gemini can explicitly request thorough analysis or even use a self-critique approach: “Give your answer, then analyze if it fully addresses the question, correcting if needed.” This can push Gemini to refine its responses.
	•	Summarization and Transformation: Gemini’s massive context is a boon for summarization of very large texts. You can feed an entire lengthy report or multiple articles and ask for a summary or comparative analysis. A nuance from testing: when asked to summarize in specific formats (like a tweet, a speech, a kids’ story), Gemini’s responses were sometimes off-target in style – e.g. trying to cram too many points into a single tweet, or over-explaining in a speech ￼. To get around this, be extremely specific about style and key points. For instance: “Summarize the above document as a Tweet in one sentence highlighting only the main finding.” If you want multiple formats, consider prompting one format at a time for best focus (Gemini can do multi-output in one go, but it may not excel at all formats equally without guidance). Alternatively, you can say: “Summarize the above in three ways. For the tweet: keep it under 280 characters and witty. For the speech: make it motivational with 2 key takeaways. For the kids’ story: use simple language and one moral at the end.” The additional instructions will help Gemini tailor each format properly, rather than treating each format generically. Essentially, don’t assume Gemini will implicitly understand the nuances of each audience or format – spell it out.
	•	Leveraging the MoE Architecture: While you cannot directly control which expert is used, you can infer how to prompt for certain domains. If your task is a coding task, including some code or error trace in the prompt will activate the code expert and likely yield better results (Gemini was designed to handle code and even entire repositories ￼). For a multilingual task, providing a sentence in the target language or explicitly stating “(Answer in Spanish)” helps. The mixture-of-experts means Gemini can tap into specialized capacities on the fly ￼, but it needs the right cues. Anecdotally, Gemini may occasionally produce inconsistent formatting or less deterministic output because different experts contribute. To mitigate any instability (e.g. if you get slightly different answers each run), you might lower the temperature or increase top_p constraint for more focused outputs. That said, Gemini 2.5 Pro is highly capable and typically yields detailed, accurate answers – often “more detailed and accurate responses” on the same prompts than earlier Google models ￼. So the main “trick” is ensuring your prompt triggers the detail you want and not detail you don’t want.
	•	Parameters Tuning: Google’s API for Gemini likely offers temperature, top_p, etc., similar to others. The default may be set for balanced performance. If you need very deterministic outputs (say for an application), use a low temperature (0–0.2) and possibly a high top_p (~0.9-1 to not starve it of vocabulary). If you want Gemini to be more creative or exploratory, raise temperature towards 0.8+. One thing to note: because Gemini can generate extremely long outputs (up to 64k tokens in one response) ￼, make sure to set a reasonable max_output_tokens or the equivalent, especially if you don’t actually want a novella. For example, if you ask it to “write a detailed report”, it might literally give you a 50k-token report if not bounded! So include either in-prompt instructions about length or use the API parameter for max tokens to cut it off. Also, given the context is huge, the runtime might be higher for very large prompts/outputs – another reason to be precise so it doesn’t go on tangents with all that freedom.

In summary, Gemini is a powerhouse with the right prompt: you can feed it vast amounts of data, multiple modalities, and it will intelligently analyze and synthesize. To get the best results, explicitly guide its focus and format because it tends to be extremely thorough by nature. It’s like a super-smart student that sometimes writes too much in an answer – so as the prompt engineer, you need to tell it when to be brief or exactly how to format the response. When you do, it can produce high-quality, human-feeling answers; in many tests it holds its own against OpenAI’s best ￼ ￼. Play to its strengths: use it for big inputs, multimedia analysis, and complex reasoning where that massive context and specialized expertise will shine. And don’t be afraid to be specific and even a bit repetitive in your prompt instructions – clarity is rewarded, as with all these models.

Conclusion

Prompt engineering remains as much an art as a science, but knowing the nuances of each model family helps immensely in crafting effective prompts:
	•	OpenAI GPT: highly reliable following of instructions, with system prompts and new cues to invoke deeper reasoning or tool use. Use chain-of-thought and role-play instructions to guide reasoning and style, and adjust temperature for creativity vs. precision ￼ ￼.
	•	Anthropic Claude: excellent at lengthy, thoughtful responses especially when allowed to think out loud. Use its extended reasoning mode or ask for step-by-step solutions for complex tasks ￼. It benefits from gentle high-level guidance and can ingest very large contexts – so provide all relevant info and let it reason, while steering format with tags or clear examples ￼ ￼.
	•	Google Gemini: unparalleled context and multimodal input handling. Great logical capabilities, but prompt it with clear directives to avoid overly verbose or unfocused answers. Tap into its strengths by feeding comprehensive inputs and using explicit format/length constraints to shape the output ￼ ￼.

By applying these model-specific techniques – from saying “Let’s think step by step” or “think hard” to a GPT, to using <thinking> scratchpads with Claude, to structuring a massive multimodal query for Gemini – you can elicit the best each model has to offer. Each has unique features (tools, constitutional guardrails, mixture-of-experts, etc.), so tailor your approach accordingly. Ultimately, all three systems reward clarity, context, and example in prompts, but the details above will help you push the right buttons for that extra edge in reasoning quality or creative flair that is especially effective for the given AI. Happy prompting!
