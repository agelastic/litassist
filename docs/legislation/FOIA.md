# Part VI—Internal review of decisions 

52 Internal review of decisions—guide 

This Part provides for internal review of decisions by agencies, other than decisions made personally by the principal officer of an agency or the responsible Minister. Agencies are required to complete internal reviews within 30 days. However, this period may be extended. 

Sections 53A, 53B and 53C define the terms access refusal decision , access grant decision and affected third party . These terms are used in this Part and in Parts VII and VIIA. 

53 Interpretation 

For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, a claim that a document would, if it exists, be an exempt document under section 33 or 34 is to be deemed to be a claim that the document is an exempt document under that section despite the fact that the existence or non-existence of the document is not acknowledged. 

53A What is an access refusal decision ?

An access refusal decision is any of the following decisions: 

(a) a decision refusing to give access to a document in accordance with a request; 

(b) a decision giving access to a document but not giving, in accordance with the request, access to all documents to which the request relates; 

(c) a decision purporting to give, in accordance with a request, access to all documents to which the request relates, but not actually giving that access; Authorised Version C2025C00174 registered 01/03/2025 Internal review of decisions Part VI

# Part VIIB—Investigations and complaints 

## Division 1—Guide to this Part 

68 Investigations and complaints—guide 

This Part is about investigations by the Information Commissioner and by the Ombudsman. 

Division 2 sets up a system for investigations by the Information Commissioner. 

The Information Commissioner may investigate an action taken by an agency in the performance of functions or the exercise of powers under this Act on a complaint from a person, or on the Information Commissioner’s initiative. 

If a person disputes the merits of an access refusal decision or an access grant decision, this Act provides elsewhere for the review of that decision (see Parts VI, VII and VIIA). 

However, this does not prevent a person from making a complaint to the Information Commissioner about the way in which the agency has handled the decision. 

The Information Commissioner has powers to obtain documents, to question persons and to enter premises (see Subdivision D of Division 2). 

At the conclusion of the investigation, the Information Commissioner must give a notice to the complainant and to the respondent agency about the Information Commissioner’s findings, with any recommendations that the Information Commissioner believes the agency ought to implement (see section 86).
